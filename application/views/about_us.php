		TheLeftEye is not only restricted to the field of Augmented Reality applications, no, we have our roots in the domain of game designing as well. We have a team of highly motivated and passionate designers and animators working side by side with a team of skilled and visionary writers who fuel our games with jaw dropping stories and visuals. We are currently developing games for mobile only and the games that are currently on the working deck are being developed using Unity, but in future, we plan to move ahead and start developing games using Unreal engine. But we do not plan on stopping just here, no, we have plans of developing games for PCs and other such consoles as well in near future.
